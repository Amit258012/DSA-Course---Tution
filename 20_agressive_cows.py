"""
The goal is to place
k elements (e.g., cows) in the given stalls such that the minimum distance between any two elements is maximized. This problem can be solved with a binary search approach on the possible distance values.

Binary Search Range: The search range for distances is between 1 and the difference between the farthest and closest stalls (stalls[-1] - stalls[0]).
Check Feasibility with canWePlace: For each midpoint distance, use canWePlace to check if itâ€™s possible to place
k elements such that the minimum distance between them is at least the midpoint.
Adjust the Search:
If placing is possible, increase the minimum distance by moving l to mid + 1 and update res to mid.
If not possible, reduce the maximum distance by moving r to mid - 1.

Time Complexity: O(nlog(max(dist)))
Space Complexity: O(1)
