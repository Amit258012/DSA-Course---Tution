# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

"""
We use the sliding window technique with two pointers: left_pointer and right_pointer to maintain a window of unique characters.
A set (char_set) is used to keep track of the characters in the current window.
If a character at right_pointer is already in the set, we move the left_pointer to the right until we remove the duplicate character from the set.
At each step, we calculate the current window size (right_pointer - left_pointer + 1) and update the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
