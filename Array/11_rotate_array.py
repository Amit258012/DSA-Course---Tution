# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/

"""
The goal is to rotate the array nums to the right by k steps. Instead of using extra space or shifting elements one by one, we can solve this problem in-place using the reverse method. The idea is to reverse the entire array, then reverse the first k elements, and finally reverse the remaining elements. This ensures that the elements are placed in their correct rotated positions.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
