# https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

"""
The goal is to group words (strings) that are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order (e.g., "bat" and "tab"). To group the anagrams, we can sort each string's characters to form a key and store the original strings in a hash map (hmap) using the sorted string as the key. All strings with the same sorted key are anagrams and will be grouped together in the hash map.

Time Complexity: O(n * k log k)
Space Complexity: O(n * k)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
