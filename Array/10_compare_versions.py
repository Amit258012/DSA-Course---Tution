# https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/

"""
To solve this, we can split each version string into parts using the dot (.) separator, convert each part to an integer, and compare the corresponding parts one by one. If a part is missing in one version (due to unequal lengths of the versions), we treat it as 0. Based on the comparison of the parts, we return:

1 if version1 is greater,
-1 if version2 is greater,
0 if both versions are equal.

Time Complexity: O(max(n, m))
Space Complexity: O(n + m)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
