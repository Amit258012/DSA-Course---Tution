"""
 we can traverse the array from right to left, keeping track of the maximum element (right_most) seen so far. If the current element is greater than or equal to this maximum, it is a leader, and we add it to the result list. After traversing the array, we reverse the result to maintain the correct order.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Can you solve by looping forward ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
