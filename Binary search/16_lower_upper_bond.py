# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/description/

"""
The problem asks to find the first and last occurrence of a target value in a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, Binary Search is the ideal approach to efficiently find the target values:

We can perform two separate binary searches:
One to find the first occurrence of the target.
Another to find the last occurrence of the target.

First Occurrence (first function):
Use Binary Search to find the first occurrence of the target.
If nums[mid] == target, record the index res and continue searching the left half (r = mid - 1), to ensure it's the first occurrence.


Last Occurrence (last function):
Use Binary Search to find the last occurrence of the target.
If nums[mid] == target, record the index res and continue searching the right half (l = mid + 1), to ensure it's the last occurrence.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
