# https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/

"""
To reverse a linked list, we iterate through each node while keeping track of the previous node. At each step, we reverse the direction of the current nodeâ€™s next pointer to point to the previous node instead of the next. We then move forward in the list by updating our pointers, and by the end of the loop, prev will point to the new head of the reversed list.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
