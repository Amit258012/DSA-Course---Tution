"""
The goal is to find the minimum integer speed k at which a person can eat all piles of bananas within 
h hours. This is a binary search problem on the speed range, where for each speed 
k we calculate the total hours required to finish all piles. By adjusting 
k based on whether the hours are within or exceed 
h, we can efficiently find the minimum feasible eating speed.

Binary Search Range: Start with the speed range from 1 to the largest pile, as the speed must be between these limits.
Calculate Hours for Each Speed: For a given speed 
k, calculate the total hours needed using calcTotalHr.
Adjust the Search:
If the hours are within 
h, try a smaller speed by decreasing high to check if thereâ€™s a lower possible eating speed.
If the hours exceed 
h, increase low to try a higher speed.

Time Complexity: O(nlog(max(piles)))
Space Complexity: O(1)
