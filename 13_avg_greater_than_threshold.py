# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/description/

"""
We use a sliding window technique to maintain the sum of k consecutive elements at all times.
Initially, we sum up the first k-1 elements, then for every new element in the array starting from k-1, we add it to the current window and check the average.
After checking the average, we subtract the element that moves out of the window (from the left side) and repeat this for the entire array.
If the average of a window is greater than or equal to the threshold, we increment the count.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
