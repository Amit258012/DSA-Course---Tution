"""
The approach is to sort the list first and then use the two-pointer technique to find the triplets. For each number nums[i], we use two pointers (j starting from i+1 and k from the end of the list) to find two numbers such that their sum with nums[i] equals zero. By moving the pointers based on the sum, we can efficiently find all valid triplets. To ensure uniqueness, we skip duplicate numbers during the iteration.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn + n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you think of brute force ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
