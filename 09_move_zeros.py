# https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

"""
 We maintain two pointers, slow and fast. The fast pointer iterates over the array, and whenever a non-zero element is found at fast, we swap it with the element at the slow pointer (if the element at slow is zero). The slow pointer is used to track where the next non-zero element should be placed.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Can you solve it by different way ? Anyway try to do itðŸ˜…
